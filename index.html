      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Chika Egulemu, a passionate and highly driven creative with a deep
        love for storytelling through design. With over six years of experience
        in branding, visual communication, and motion design, I specialize in
        bringing ideas to life through bold visuals and clean, intentional
        aesthetics. My creative journey started with a certification from
        Ambidextrous Design HUB and has since grown into a purpose-led career
        that connects people, builds identity, and drives engagement across
        various platforms. Beyond design, I’m inspired by culture, innovation,
        and community. I believe in using creativity as a tool to educate,
        inspire, and uplift. I’ve worked with diverse clients—from startups to
        public sector bodies—crafting logos, campaigns, and visual systems that
        speak authentically to audiences. I value impact, clarity, and
        collaboration, and I’m always learning and pushing boundaries to better
        serve those I work with. Whether I’m sketching new concepts, animating
        motion graphics, or leading a rebrand, I bring intention, empathy, and
        excellence to the table. Outside of work, I’m a lifelong learner, a
        lover of music, and a voice for empowering young talents. I’m building a
        creative legacy, one design at a time.
